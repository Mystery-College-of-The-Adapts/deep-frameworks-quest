Real-world examples make the abstract description of machine learning become concrete.

In this post you will go on a tour of real world machine learning problems. You will see how machine learning can actually be used in fields like education, science, technology and medicine.

Each machine learning problem listed also includes a link to the publicly available dataset. This means that if a particular concrete machine learning problem interest you, you can download the dataset and start practicing immediately.

## **Final World**

We took a whirlwind tour of 20 real-world machine learning problems.

These are actual problems posed or investigated by science and business organizations around the world.

What’s even more exciting is that these diverse problems have publicly available datasets and are also widely studied and understood.

This means you can download the data right now and explore the problem by implementing your own model, or reproduce someone else’s from a paper or blog post.
