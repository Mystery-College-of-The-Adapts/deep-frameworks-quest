# Linear Regression

Linear regression may be one of the most important algorithms in statistics, machine
learning, and science in general. It's one of the most used algorithms and it is very important
to understand how to implement it and its various flavors. One of the advantages that linear
regression has over many other algorithms is that it is very interpretable. We end up with a
number for each feature that directly represents how that feature influences the target or
dependent variable.
